NEO: A distributed network for the Smart Economy

The Blockchain Store intends to address these deficiencies with the creation of a
decentralized e-commerce platform .The Block will implement smart contracts to provide an
e-commerce infrastructure and use cryptocurrency for customer purchases and merchant
listing fees .By using smart contracts for the creation of the online store and BCS's native
currency, the project eliminates the need for third parties that have previously always been
necessary for hosting and payment processing.
One important consequence of its decentralized design is that The Blockchain Store
will further enhance user privacy .Not only can cryptocurrency payments offer a strong
element of anonymity, but there will be no third parties collecting user data .The Blockchain
Store itself does not need any personal data, operating in a permission-less manner and
performing no monitoring .A user needs only the BCS application and a small amount of
coins to get started and connect to the BCS Blockchain.

NEO uses digital identity and blockchain technology to  and leverages smart contracts for autonomously managed digital assets to create a "smart economy" within a decentralized network.

How to Contribute
You can contribute to NEO with issues and PRs. Simply filing issues for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing implementations is greatly appreciated.

We use and recommend the following workflow:

Create an issue for your work.
You can skip this step for trivial changes.
Reuse an existing issue on the topic, if there is one.
Clearly state that you are going to take on implementing it, if that's the case. You can request that the issue be assigned to you. Note: The issue filer and the implementer don't have to be the same person.

Create a personal fork of the repository on GitHub (if you don't already have one).

Create a branch off of master(git checkout -b mybranch).
Name the branch so that it clearly communicates your intentions, such as issue-123 or githubhandle-issue.
Branches are useful since they isolate your changes from incoming changes from upstream. They also enable you to create multiple PRs from the same fork.
Make and commit your changes.
Add new tests corresponding to your change, if applicable.
Build the repository with your changes.
Make sure that the builds are clean.
Make sure that the tests are all passing, including your new tests.
Create a pull request (PR) against the upstream repository's master branch.
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

Note: It is OK for your PR to include a large number of commits. Once your change is accepted, you will be asked to squash your commits into one or some appropriately small number of commits before your PR is merged.
